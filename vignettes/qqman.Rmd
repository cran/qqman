The **qqman** package includes functions for creating manhattan plots and q-q plots from GWAS results. The `gwasResults` data.frame included with the package has simulated results for 16,470 SNPs on 22 chromosomes. Take a look at the data:

```{r}
str(gwasResults)
head(gwasResults)
tail(gwasResults)
```

How many SNPs on each chromosome?

```{r}
as.data.frame(table(gwasResults$CHR))
```

## Creating manhattan plots

Now, let's make a basic manhattan plot. 

```{r}
manhattan(gwasResults)
```

We can also pass in other graphical parameters. Let's add a title (`main=`), reduce the point size to 50%(`cex=`), and reduce the font size of the axis labels to 80% (`cex.axis=`):

```{r}
manhattan(gwasResults, main="Manhattan Plot", cex=0.5, cex.axis=0.8)
```

Let's change the colors and increase the maximum y-axis:

```{r}
manhattan(gwasResults, col=c("blue4", "orange3"), ymax=12)
```

Let's remove the suggestive and genome-wide significance lines:

```{r}
manhattan(gwasResults, suggestiveline=F, genomewideline=F)
```

Let's look at a single chromosome:

```{r}
manhattan(subset(gwasResults, CHR==1))
```

Let's highlight some SNPs of interest on chromosome 3. The 100 SNPs we're highlighting here are in a character vector called `snpsOfInterest`. You'll get a warning if you try to highlight SNPs that don't exist.

```{r}
str(snpsOfInterest)
manhattan(gwasResults, highlight=snpsOfInterest)
```

We can combine highlighting and limiting to a single chromosome:

```{r}
manhattan(subset(gwasResults, CHR==3), highlight=snpsOfInterest, main="Chr 3")
```

A few notes on creating manhattan plots:

* Run `str(gwasResults)`. Notice that the `gwasResults` data.frame has SNP, chromosome, position, and p-value columns named `SNP`, `CHR`, `BP`, and `P`. If you're creating a manhattan plot and your column names are different, you'll have to pass the column names to the `chr=`, `bp=`, `p=`, and `snp=` arguments. See `help(manhattan)` for details.
* The chromosome column must be numeric. If you have "X," "Y," or "MT" chromosomes, you'll need to rename these 23, 24, 25, etc.
* If you'd like to change the color of the highlight or the suggestive/genomewide lines, you'll need to modify the source code. Search for `col="blue"`, `col="red"`, or `col="green3"` to modify the suggestive line, genomewide line, and highlight colors, respectively.

## Creating Q-Q plots

Creating Q-Q plots is straightforward - simply supply a vector of p-values to the `qq()` function. You can optionally provide a title.

```{r}
qq(gwasResults$P, main="Q-Q plot of GWAS p-values")
```
